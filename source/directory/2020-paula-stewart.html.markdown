I love building bridges between team members, business groups or between business groups and IT. In my Agile coaching I am passionate about identifying and promoting individual strengths. I shine a light on those strengths to others in the organization in a way that builds confidence and strong team dynamics. Doctors, nurses, purchasing directors, lawyers, and product managers, have noted that I quickly understand their world and empower them in their roles. Through understanding someone else's world, I have had clients thank me for “being their lifeboat in a project”, for “changing their work and making it fun”, and for “making complex concepts very accessible”. My goal in transformation is for my clients to be inspired, effective, and empowered.

My first Agile project was building a data warehouse as a data architect and engineer in the late 1990s. It was Agile because we were following what I later learned were Agile values and principles. I continue to find models, methods and approaches to better coach product managers, and scrum masters as an Agile coach. I am committed to creating cultures that promote cross-functional team collaboration and open communications. I bring my background in Agile, enterprise data management, IT portfolio, and product management to transform organizations.

I fully committed to XSCALE when I recognized that it delivered on the promise of scaling Agile without abandoning the core Agile values and principles. XSCALE’s simple elegance provides a systems approach to dealing with complex systems, and the fragility in relationships between complex systems.

<!-- Write your personal summary below. You can use Markdown formatting. -->

A specialist in exponential growth.

Nick has doubled the revenues of many organizations he has worked with every year.
He is achieving it through a blend of 2 key components:

 * Organisation Engineering.
   Nick's research into the connection between human capability and technological capability 
   has informed some of Australia's most innovative and prestigious hospitals.
 * Technical Excellence.
   Nick has successfully built several of Australia and New Zealand's 
   most widely-used healthcare and telecommunications systems.

He believes that there is nothing more agile than a well-constructed hierarchy, 
and nothing more miserable than a badly-constructed hierarchy. 
His research aims to fully understand the difference.

Jon likes learning about everything: business, people, software development, languages, brain science, improv; pretty much whatever he runs into.   Jon spent 17 years working in Japan, learning to be Lean, Agile, and to flow with work. Jon has literally won a competitive Japanese game show.

During his travels to Japan, Jon set up the Xbox and Apple Xserve call centers, and took call escalations in Japanese for many years. Making a difference in people’s lives by being of service to them, is his passion.  Jon brings many people together to discover what’s possible, when facing a challenge. He emboldens emerging leadership everywhere in the enterprise.

Coaching teams and leaders is a passion of Jon’s. He won’t fix or protect people, because they don’t need it. Instead he gets curious about them, and what they really care about.  If they feel “stuck” he helps them find their way to break through. That’s Jon’s happy place; where people are being awesome and are acknowledged for their greatness.  

He sees the irony in life, sees his mistakes, and relishes learning from both. He appreciates the counter-intuitive bits of work, and rolls with it.  He feels he’s at his best amidst uncertainty. Based in Mission Viejo, California, if given the opportunity to sail a boat, Jon will try even in gusty conditions. He has capsized more than once; no damage nor casualties.  On weekends his wife and children don’t sail with him, and keep his phone dry.

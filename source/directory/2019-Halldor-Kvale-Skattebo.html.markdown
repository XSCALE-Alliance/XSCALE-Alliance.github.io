I am an Enterprise Agile Coach with over 6 years of experience 
leading agile transformations in large organizations as well as in small businesses. 
I believe in unlocking the potential of the individual, the team, the leadership 
and the whole organization by providing both great experience 
as well as the sum of different frameworks and methods. 
Cultural change and new ways of decisions is the main key for all change.

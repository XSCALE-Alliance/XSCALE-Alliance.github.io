XSCALE is not a framework; it is a collection of toolkits. 
By presenting each tool in the toolkit in context of the problem it aims to solve, 
you as an XSCALE practicioner can pick only the tools you need _now_
to address your organization's single bottleneck constraint.
You don't need the other tools now!

XSCALE is divided into three toolkits that, together, cover all the needs of an agile organization:

 * XSCALE Business Agility ([XBA]) which generates self-directing portfolios of self-managing value streams that continuously identify and prioritise bottlenecks in business throughput and learning flow across the organization.
 * XSCALE Product Management ([XPM]) which aligns tech, design and business leaders, breadth-first, to form a product team that continuously distils value stream drivers and constraints into a maximum-impact release plan.
 * XDevOps ([XDO]) which extends agility to all delivery and operational functions of a value stream. XDO is high test DevOps based on Kim's Three Ways, Extreme Programming, Git Workflows, 3D Kanban, BDD, CI/CDD, Infrastructure as Code and Game Without Thrones.

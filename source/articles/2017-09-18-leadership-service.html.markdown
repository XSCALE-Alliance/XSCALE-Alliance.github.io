FBI agent Dale Cooper seems the model of servant leadership. While Twin
Peaks\' townspeople look to him for direction, Cooper never commands or
controls them. He provides leadership only when they actually need it
and when it\'s his responsibility.

But finding Dale Cooper can be hard! And adding Cooper to a culture of
black-hearted \"Bobs\" will always fail unless we change the rules of
the game. This post is about how simple changes to decision-making
protocols let your servant-leader Coopers thrive.

Why? Think back to your very first job. Remember how it felt. What were
the rules? No one ever explained them! Why did people act like they did?
Slowly, it all became normal. Then you shifted jobs and had to learn a
new culture with new rules \...

This simulation explains the reasons for these culture games. It\'s not
the mix of individual players that makes the culture but the rules of
the game. These rules promote or prevent mutually beneficial behaviours.
So, to change the culture, change the rules.

This post is about a simple way to do that we call \"Leadership as a
Service\". \"LaaS\" for short*.* It generates servant-leadership in
teams ranging from rambunctious DevOps squads to political C-suites to
feuding tribes on horseback.

Er \... feuding tribes on horseback?

Riding horses doesn\'t make people stupid. The history of the Iroquoian
peoples demonstrates patterns that generated peaceful servant leadership
among even the bloodiest warlords for several hundred years. Including
two centuries of inter-operation with the European powers. And
\"Hiawatha\" was their Dale Cooper \...

The Iroquois [Great Law of Peace](http://www.ganienkeh.net/thelaw.html)
is a complex historical document and not all of it is relevant or even
feasible in modern corporate life. We can\'t be clubbing people on the
head no matter how they act \... but we can adapt these ideas as a
pattern language for self-management in modern teams and streams.

Alexander defined a [pattern
language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_language) as \"proven
solutions to repeating problems in a common context\". One pattern\'s
solution may give rise to problems solved by others, so patterns
naturally chain together to form a language. XP is an example of a
pattern language. Scrum is another.

So here are three patterns that combine to generate leadership as a
service even when you\'re all out of Coopers and Hiawathas.

Leadership-as-a-Service Patterns
--------------------------------

1.  **Directly Responsible Individuals (\"DRIs\"):** Committees without
    individual responsibilities inevitably compromise decisions and
    disempower members by taking agency away from them. **Therefore*,***
    attach a **D**irectly **R**esponsible **I**ndividual to every agenda
    item in a meeting or work item in a backlog. This DRI carries sole
    responsibility for execution of the item, and for servant-leading
    their team on decisions about that item via *Decide The Decider*.
2.  **Balance of Powers:** Per the Agile Manifesto, [the best decisions
    emerge from small, self-organizing
    teams](http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html). Self-organization
    only occurs among a team of peers because giving an individual the
    authority to overrule their team stops it self-organizing.
    **Therefore*,*** only ask a DRI for a decision if their team of
    peers runs out of time to reach unanimous consensus. If the team is
    unanimous except for the DRI, they overrule the DRI.
3.  **Decide the Decider:** someone must decide which DRIs to attach to
    agenda or work items. And someone must decide the timeframe for
    making decisions about the item. **Therefore,** designate a Speaker
    to decide when the team is out of time to reach unanimity on an
    item. And designate a Leader to decide which DRI to attach to each
    item. These two functions may be embodied in one person, but in any
    case neither Leader nor Speaker may overrule a DRI unless the rest
    of the team unanimously agree with them.

This little pattern language promotes team autonomy. In conjunction with
the [Round
Councils](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/round-councils-peter-merel/)
pattern-language it also promotes team alignment, enabling multiple
teams in a value stream to manage themselves. And multiple streams in a
portfolio.

The process of changing from a command and control hierarchy to a
culture of leadership as a service requires a self-organizing method of
transformation too. And that\'s [another pattern
language](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/exponential-agile-transformation-quicker-cheaper-safer-peter-merel/)
